## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=14H0u0kllllbhLjgjtoqndivp5f

Your Rationale: I went with a purple monochromatic color palette for the video game console platform. The biggest reason for this is kinda selfish because purple is my favorite color ,however after the reading it is associated with wealthy ideas which would pair well with a potential high income game console. This color is also not associated with any major players in the market either as green is for Microsoft's Xbox and blue is for Sony's Playstation.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52F080kllrKrQfRoqn5iewVetIZ

Your Rationale: For this I tried to get light greens that are soothing to look as its spring time. Gardens are known for their vibrant nature so a collection of greens just make the most sense here.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=304100kpWyteKMokLDQvQtuykm5

Your Rationale: I went with a red blue and yellow triadic color palette as the colors are meant to increase educational effectivness. Red is used as a energizer to get the brain rolling as it pops on the page. Blue is to add a calming nature to the work they would be doing on the sit which will drive up productivity. Yellow is used to keep the attention of kids as it is full of energy and creates a warm feeling.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=b3H4-440ku-mqfY+ZqVta-hiYUY1r

Your Rationale: For this one when i think of cybersecurity I always get a blue color to mind so for this palette i used a dark blue and purple combo with a contrasting white or black. I could see a dark blue background with white being the default scheme for this which just screams computer to me.
