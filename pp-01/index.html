    <h1> Oswald & Anton </h1>
    <p> These two fonts are extremely similar expect for the boldness of Anton and that is exactly
        why i picked these two fonts for each other. Anton natively just fits as the complementary header or title
        font that should be paired with Oswald. The individual lettering for both these fonts also match almost to a T
        when overlapping each other. Both fonts come from a revised sans serif font family and both date to around 2011 for their inception. </p>
