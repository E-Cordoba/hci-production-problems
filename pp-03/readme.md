## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/text-fields/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I implemented this guideline by adding hint text within the data input location better guide the user when it comes to creating a account.
  The previous version provided no example text so it might have been difficult to understand fully what they meant by a UI design point

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I implemented this guide line by using the color red as a attention grabber to required fields for account creation to make the process easier to complete. The previous design incorperated zero color making the page juts a bore to look at and might make users miss the required text for certain data fields.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/navigation-bars/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I implemented this guideline by creating a quick bar for the creation process this would allow users to quickly be taken to a certain filed that might have a mistake and quickly fix it instead of having to scroll and find said mistake. The previous version of the site required constant scrolling to complete the form which might annoy the user so its made more convenient with a quick bar.

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
